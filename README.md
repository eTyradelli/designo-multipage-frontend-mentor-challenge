## Overview

Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Eleana and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer from Greece.

This is my solution to the [Designo agency website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

I started by creating a design system where I set up the main styles and css variables and built all the reusable components. Then I created a style.css file where I migrated all the shared styles. For each individual page, I also created a respective css file for page specific styles, components and variations.

This project uses minimal JavaScript for:

- The mobile toggle
- Loading the maps on the locations.html
- Smooth scrolling to a specific location in the locations.html, via a link on another page
- Client-side validation on the contact form

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library


### Continued development

Next update for this project will focus on improving accessibility.
